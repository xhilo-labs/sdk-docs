# Test Summary for @xhilo/pi-sdk

## 🧪 Test Coverage Overview

I have created comprehensive tests for the Pi React SDK package to verify all functionality works correctly. Here's a summary of what has been tested:

## ✅ Test Files Created

### 1. **PiNetworkClient Tests** (`src/__tests__/PiNetworkClient.test.ts`)
- **Constructor Tests**: Sandbox mode initialization
- **Initialize Method**: SDK initialization, script loading, timeout handling
- **Authentication**: User authentication with scopes, error handling
- **Logout**: Session cleanup and state management
- **Payment Creation**: U2A payment creation with callbacks
- **Validation Methods**: 
  - Withdrawal validation (amount, minimum, balance checks)
  - Task completion validation (user auth, task ID, reward validation)
  - Wallet address validation (format, availability checks)
  - Ad reward eligibility (daily limits, user authentication)
- **Metadata Preparation**: Title, description, image, URL validation
- **Ad Methods**: Show ads, check readiness, request ads
- **Share Dialog**: Opening share dialogs
- **Utility Methods**: Initialization status, user management

### 2. **useXhiloPiNetwork Hook Tests** (`src/__tests__/useXhiloPiNetwork.test.tsx`)
- **Hook Initialization**: Default values and state management
- **Method Availability**: All required methods are present
- **Sandbox Mode**: Proper handling of sandbox vs production
- **Message Handling**: Pi Network message processing and origin validation
- **Method Delegation**: All methods properly delegate to client
- **State Updates**: User and initialization state updates
- **Console Logging**: Debug log capture and retrieval

### 3. **XhiloPiProvider Tests** (`src/__tests__/XhiloPiProvider.test.tsx`)
- **Provider Rendering**: Children rendering and context provision
- **SDK Initialization**: Automatic initialization on mount
- **Callback Handling**: onInitialized, onError, onUserAuthenticated callbacks
- **Sandbox Mode**: Proper sandbox configuration
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and reporting
- **Context Hooks**: useXhiloPi, useXhiloPiLogs, useXhiloPiReady, useXhiloPiUser
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error throwing when used outside provider

### 4. **Integration Tests** (`src/__tests__/integration.test.tsx`)
- **End-to-End Flow**: Complete SDK usage through provider
- **User Authentication**: Full authentication flow
- **Payment Processing**: Payment creation and management
- **Ad Display**: Ad showing and management
- **Wallet Operations**: Wallet validation and management
- **Error Scenarios**: Various error conditions and recovery
- **State Management**: Proper state updates throughout the flow

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration
- **Environment**: jsdom for React component testing
- **Setup**: Custom setup file with mocks and utilities
- **Coverage**: 80% threshold for branches, functions, lines, statements
- **Path Mapping**: Proper module resolution for imports

### Mocking Strategy
- **Pi SDK**: Complete window.Pi mock with all methods
- **PiNetworkClient**: Mocked client with all methods
- **React Hooks**: Proper hook testing with renderHook
- **DOM APIs**: Document and window API mocking
